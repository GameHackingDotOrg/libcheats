   About libcheats
---===============---

libcheats is a library that can read, manipulate, and write cheat codes in text
format.

Although libcheats is quite generic, the current version expects one code line
to be two 32-bit words. Therefore, you can only use it for systems like the PS2.
Without this size limitation, I hope that libcheats will someday become a standard
library when it comes to cheat code parsing/processing.

   Build
---=====---

To compile libcheats, you need CMake and a C compiler like gcc.
I recommend doing an out-of-source build:
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make

To install libcheats:
# make install


---==---
   Usage
---=====---

Simply link the library to your project and include the header files.

Take a look at the source files in the test directory for working samples.
